## Business Case
Government agencies in UK are using more resources than necessary by deploying the incorrect number of first responders at the wrong times of the year. 
My capstone project attempts to minimize the mismanagement of resources while ensuring there are enough numbers on the ground to attend to those involved in accidents.

## Methodology

1. I downloaded the number of accidents dataset from the UK traffic department.
2. I used Python to clean, explore and analyze the data.
3. Finally I applied SARIMA to train the model and forecast the number of accidents in the months ahead. 

By empowing the relevant parties with this insight into the future, I hope they can better plan and manage the deployement of resources at any given time of the year.
